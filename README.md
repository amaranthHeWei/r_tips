# Tutorial style guide  

This repository now contains the following file naming and code style rules.  

+ Folders are no longer ordered with a numerical prefix and names are no longer case sensitive e.g `r_tips\tutorials\...` and `r_tips\figures\...`    
+ Tutorial subtopics share the same prefix e.g. `r_tips\tutorials\dv-...` and   `r_tips\tutorials\st-...`  
+ File names contain `-` to separate file name prefixes and `_` instead of other white space e.g. `r_tips\figures\dv-using_diagrammer-simple_flowchart.svg`  
+ Comments are styled according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html?q=comments#comments-1):    
  + The first comment explains the purpose of the code chunk and is styled differently for enhanced readability e.g. `# Code as header --------`     
  + Comments are written in sentence case and only end with a full stop if they contain at least two sentences  
  + Short comments explaining a function argument do not have to be written on a new line  
  + Comments should not be followed by a blank line, unless the comment is a stand-alone paragraph containing in-depth rationale or an alternative solution  
+ R code chunks are styled as follows:  
  + Each R chunk should be named with a short unique description written in the active voice e.g. `create basic plot` and `modify plot labels`    
  + Arguments inside code chunks should not contain white space and boolean argument options should be written in capitals e.g. `{r load libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}`   
  + To render the github document, results are generally suppressed using `results='hide'` and manually entered in a new line beneath the code.  
  + To render the github document, figures are generally outputed using `fig.show='markdown'` and figure outputs can then be suppressed at the local chunk level using `fig.show='hide'`  
+ Set a margin of 80 characters length in RStudio through `Tools\Global options --> Code --> Display --> Show margin` and use this margin as the cut-off for code and comments length
