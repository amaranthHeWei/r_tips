# Tutorial style guide  

This repository now contains the following file naming and code style rules.  

+ Folders are not ordered with a numerical prefix and names are not case sensitive e.g `r_tips\tutorials\...` and `r_tips\figures\...`    
+ Tutorial subtopics share the same prefix e.g. `r_tips\tutorials\dv-...` for data visualisation tutorials and `r_tips\tutorials\sm-...` for statistical modelling tutorials     
+ File names use `-` to separate tutorial topics and `_` instead of other white space e.g. `r_tips\figures\dv-using_diagrammer-simple_flowchart.svg`  
+ Comments are styled according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html?q=comments#comments-1):    
  + The first comment explains the purpose of the code chunk and is styled differently for enhanced readability e.g. `# Code as header --------`     
  + Comments are written in sentence case and only end with a full stop if they contain at least two sentences  
  + Short comments explaining a function argument do not have to be written on a new line  
  + Comments should not be followed by a blank line, unless the comment is a stand-alone paragraph containing in-depth rationale or an alternative solution   
+ To render github documents:    
  + Results are generally suppressed using `results='hide'` and manually entered in a new line beneath the code  
  + Figures are generally outputed using `fig.show='markdown'` and individual figure outputs can then be suppressed using `fig.show='hide'` in a code chunk    
+ Set a margin of 80 characters length in RStudio through `Tools\Global options --> Code --> Display --> Show margin` and use this margin as the cut-off for code and comments length
