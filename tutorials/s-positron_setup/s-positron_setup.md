# Integrated Development Environments

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is simply a software
application that supports code development. Different IDEs are popular
for different languages:

- R programmers tend to use
  [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

- Cloud platform constrained Python programmers tend to use a
  proprietary variation of [JupyterLabs](https://jupyter.org/).

- Programmers switching between R, Python, Julia or other programming
  languages tend to use [Visual Studio
  Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code).

The RStudio IDE is already thoughtfully designed to support data
exploration and R code development. If you mostly program in R, I
recommend staying with the [RStudio
IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and skipping this
tutorial.

# Choosing Positron as an IDE

If you are a data scientist who loves the RStudio experience but
frequently codes in Python or Julia, then
[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/start.html) may be an appealing
IDE.

The core features of Positron are:

- It provides an [R kernel](https://github.com/posit-dev/ark) for
  Jupyter applications. This enables a separate R console beneath the R
  scripts/notebooks panel (something which JupyterLabs and VS Code lack
  for R programming).

- It provides a customisable IDE layout that is more suited for data
  exploration, with ***Variables*** and ***Plots*** panes for each R
  session, and ***Connections*** and ***Help*** panes similar to
  RStudio.

- It is built on the [open source
  version](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) of VS Code, so it
  aesthetically resembles VS Code and retains the appealing features of
  VS Code for programming in other languages.

- It supports most VS Code extensions. Microsoft does not permit access
  to Visual Studio Marketplace for non-Microsoft Visual Studio builds,
  so Positronâ€™s Visual Studio extensions are hosted by [Open
  VSX](https://open-vsx.org/).

# Positron Windows setup

My simple Windows setup only involves several steps. These are all
listed in the ***Migrating from RStudio to Positron*** walkthrough on
the Positron Welcome page.

1.  Download the [Positron IDE](https://positron.posit.co/download.html)
    onto your desktop.

    ![](../../figures/s-positron_setup-migration_walkthrough.png)

2.  Import [RStudio
    keybindings](https://positron.posit.co/rstudio-keybindings.html) by
    navigating to ***File*** \> ***Preferences*** \> ***Settings***,
    searching for `workbench.keybindings.rstudioKeybindings` and
    clicking the ***Enable*** checkbox. Restart Positron for the
    settings to take effect.

    Examples of RStudio keybindings that I use are `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    to insert a new R markdown cell and `Ctrl` + `I` to re-indent
    selected code.

3.  Opt-in to use the R code formatter
    [`air`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2025/02/air/), which
    re-formats code inside `.R`, `.Rmd` and `.Qmd` files. The easiest
    way to integrate `air` inside Positron is to enable it to format
    code on save. Navigate to ***File*** \> ***Preferences*** \>
    ***Settings***, search for `@lang:r editor.formatOnSave` and click
    the ***Format a file on save*** checkbox.

    ![](../../figures/s-positron_setup-air_demo.gif)

    The formatter `air` is used to:

    - Automatically indent R code.  
    - Splits long lines of code over multiple lines (with a default code
      line width of 80 characters).  
    - Standardises the white space around code elements.  
    - Code formatting can be manually disabled by placing `# fmt: skip`
      in front of an expression.

# Positron versus RStudio usage differences

## File organisation

In RStudio, it is best practice to set up R projects by creating an
`r_project_name.Rproj` file. This `.Rproj` file marks the project root
folder and is used by the R package `here` to build relative file paths
within a self-contained project. Double clicking on an `.Rproj` file
also launches a new R session with the project directory set as the
project root.

[Positron does not support
`.Rproj files`](https://positron.posit.co/rstudio-rproj-file.html) and
alternative practices are required.

- In Positron, navigating to ***Explorer*** \> ***Open Folder*** will
  open a directory and set it as the project root.

- If using `here`, the project root folder is also identifiable from the
  presence of the `.git/` folder. **Ensure that all your R projects use
  Git for code version control.**

- Use the
  [`Project Manager`](https://open-vsx.org/extension/alefragnani/project-manager)
  VS extension to navigate between multiple projects. In Project
  Manager, you can:

  - Set up a list of projects by manually saving individual directories
    as favourites. First open a project by navigating to ***Explorer***
    \> ***Open Folder***. Then navigate to the ***Project Manager tab***
    and click on the ***Save*** icon to save your currently open file
    directory as a new project. Projects are then listed inside a
    `projects.json` file.

  - Automatically detect directories with a `.git/` folder as projects.
    Click on the ***Project Manager tab*** and navigate down to the
    ***Git*** panel. Click ***Open Settings*** to add all the base
    folders where Git projects can be found. For example, my projects
    are found inside `C:\Users\Erika\OneDrive\Desktop\git_repos` so I
    add `C:\Users\Erika\OneDrive\Desktop\git_repos` as a file path by
    clicking ***Add Item***.

## Switching between R and Python

Positron is more versatile than RStudio for switching between R and
Python programming. There are three different use cases for programmers
who code in R and Python:

1.  The majority of your code is in R but you want to use a specific
    Python package for a task like machine learning.  
2.  You have a single project that runs both R and Python scripts.  
3.  You frequently switch between projects that only require R or
    Python.

**RStudio** supports the first use case best. We can use `reticulate` to
easily switch between Python and R code and objects within a `.Rmd` or
`.Qmd` notebook through the [`reticulate` Python
engine](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html).

Instead of relying on existing Python environments, the `reticulate`
package can embed a temporary Python session with all required packages
within an R session through
[`py_require()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_require.html).
This is the recommended practice for executing Python code within an R
session.

``` r
# Simple code to set up a temporary Python session -----------------------------
library(reticulate)

# py_require() uses the excellent Python version/environment/package manager uv
# to create temporary Python sessions.    
py_require(c(numpy,
             pandas,
             sklearn))
```

**Positron** also supports the third use case, which makes it more
appealing to users who frequently program in languages other than R. (I
recommend avoiding the second use case for projects unless you are
really desperate.)

In Positron, I can work on standalone Python (or Julia) projects by:

- 
- 
- 
- 

**Note:** Python version and environment management is notoriously
finicky. For first-time Python users, I recommend first installing and
using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install a moderately
new version Python.
