# Why linear regression?    

Linear regression is usually the first statistical model that people learn about. Although it has a reputation for being a simple method, linear regression is still used for different purposes.   

As listed in [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) by Gelman et al, linear regression can be used to:   

+ Predict or forecast outcomes without aiming to infer causality.   
+ Generate an additive explanation of the associations between independent variables of interest (also known as features) and an outcome.    
+ Adjust outcomes from a sample to infer something about a population of interest.    
+ Estimate treatment effects by comparing outcomes between a treatment and control group in a randomised controlled trial.    

Linear regression models can be easily misused when purposes deviate from the ones described above. For example, people can mistake the associations produced by a linear regression model as being causal rather than just predictive. This is especially problematic [when some of the variables fitted into a model are predictive of each other](https://elevanth.org/blog/2021/06/15/regression-fire-and-dangerous-things-1-3/).   


# Build a linear regression model 

Let's first build a linear regression model and see what results it produces. We will then learn about the mathematical properties, interpretation and assumptions of our model.      

We will provide ourselves with a safety check, by secretly knowing the precise relationship between our independent variables and the outcome of interest. This will obviously never happen in real life.   

Imagine that the amount of money a pet influencer earns per month is influenced by the following variables:    

+ A baseline monthly income   
+ Whether the pet is a dog or another animal species       
+ The number of photos their owner posts every month      
+ The number of videos their owner posts every month      

To simplify things, we state that there are no confounds between these variables i.e. the value of one variable does not influence the value of another variable.   

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR  
  A(Baseline income) --> B(Monthly income)     
  C(Is dog) --> B 
  D(Photos per month) --> B
  E(Videos per month) --> B
  
  style B fill:#Fff9e3,stroke:#333
```

We can then simulate some income data to use for modelling.  

```{r}
# Simulate pet influencer income dataset ---------------------------------------
set.seed(111)
N <- 500 # Simulate 500 observations 

# Simulate whether pet is dog, cat or other from a multinomial distribution  
species <- rmultinom(N, 
                     size = 1,
                     prob = c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1))

# Convert species into dummy variables     
is_dog <- species[1, 1:N]
is_cat <- species[2, 1:N]

# Simulate number of photos per month from a poisson distribution 
photos <- rpois(N, lambda = 6)

# Simulate number of videos per month from a poisson distribution
videos <- rpois(N, lambda = 2)

# Simulate monthly income from a normal distribution 
# Mean monthly income has an intercept of 20 and is only determined by the 
# variables is_dog, photos and videos

income <- rnorm(N,
                mean = 20 + is_dog * 60 + photos * 6 + videos * 18,
                sd = 5)

# Ensure that income is a non-negative integer
income <- ifelse(income > 0, round(income, digits = 0), 0)

# Create dataset
data <- data.frame(
  is_dog,
  is_cat,
  photos,
  videos, 
  income
)
```

We will then split the simulated data into training and test data subsets with a 75% versus 25% split.      

```{r}
# Split data into training and test data sets using base R ---------------------
set.seed(111)

# Calculate 75% of the whole data set
train_size <- floor(0.75 * nrow(data))

# Randomly sample train_size number of rows and extract the row index
train_index <- sample(seq_len(nrow(data)), size = train_size) 

train <- data[train_index, ] # Subset by train_index row index
test <- data[-train_index, ] # Subset the remaining rows
```

We will then perform multiple linear regression modelling on the training data set and view the results.    

```{r}
#| output: true

# Perform multiple linear regression -------------------------------------------
# Models are fitted with the syntax lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + ... + Xn) where Y is the
# outcome of interest and X1 ... Xn are distinct independent variables. 

mlr_model <- lm(
  train$income ~ # Y 
    train$is_dog + # X1 
    train$is_cat + # X2 
    train$photos + # X3 
    train$videos # X4 
)

# View the results of the fitted model using summary()
summary(mlr_model)
```

This looks very complicated! Let us interpret the key results above by learning about the mathematical structure of a linear regression model.   


# The mathemathical intuition   

The simplest linear regression model has the form $\hat {Y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i$.   

Graphically, this is a line of best fit through the 2D Cartesian plane. To construct this model, we only need to estimate the two parameters of an unknown straight line:  

+ The y-intercept, which we refer to as $\beta_0$.  
+ The slope, which we refer to as $\beta_1$   

We first assume that there is a **true model** which precisely predicts our outcome of interest $Y_i$ based on our independent variable of interest $X_i$. The true model has the form $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i$ represents error due to natural variation, because objects do not behave like perfect clones of each other in the real world.    

![](../../figures/st-linear_regression-true_model_structure.gif)     

Because there is always error due to natural variation, we view each observation of $Y_i$ as being drawn from a normal distribution of many possible values. After making some assumptions about how $\epsilon_i$ behaves, we can claim that the **mean** of the probability distribution of $Y_i$ is $E(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1$. $E(Y_i)$ is the unknown straight line that we want to estimate.      

![](../../figures/st-linear_regression-y_normal_distribution.svg)

We want to use our training data set to find the best point estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. This means finding the line that travels closest through all the training data set observations. This line is our **best estimated model**, which has the form $\hat Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i$. It has a y-intercept of $b_0$ and slope of $b_1$.   

![](../../figures/st-linear_regression-estimated_model_structure.gif) 

The model coefficients $b_0$ and $b_1$ are our best point estimates of the unknown $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ parameters. The point estimates for $b_0$ and $b_1$ are slightly different depending on which observations are present in our training data set.        

In this tutorial, we hypothesised that our multiple regression model had the form `lm(income ~ is_dog + is_cat + photos + videos)`. This means that we think that the mean monthly pet influencer income is the sum of:    

+ A potential baseline income (a non-zero $\beta_0$ value)   
+ An additional amount of money if the pet is a dog (a non-zero $\beta_1$ value)     
+ An additional amount of money if the pet is a cat (a non-zero $\beta_2$ value)   
+ An additional amount of money for each photo posted per month (a non-zero $\beta_3$ value)  
+ An additional amount of money for each video posted per month (a non-zero $\beta_4$ value)  

Mathematically, our best estimated model has the following structure, where $b_0, \cdots, b_4$ are the point estimates for $\beta_0, \cdots, \beta_4$ respectively.    

![](../../figures/st-linear_regression-tutorial_model_structure.svg)

Let us examine the coefficients of our model. We can output them into a tabular format using the `tidy()` function from the [`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html) package.      

```{r}
#| output: true

# Extract model coefficients and output as a tidy table ------------------------
mlr_model |> tidy()
```

The **point estimates** of the model coefficients are used to construct our best estimated model, which has the following form.   

![](../../figures/st-linear_regression-tutorial_best_estimated_model.svg)  

After examining the **point estimates**, **standard errors** and **p-values** of our model coefficients, we can also claim that the following associations exist, provided that our modelling assumptions are reasonable:   

+ A monthly baseline income of ~21.5 dollars exists. A pet influencer who posts 0 photos and videos and is not a dog earns an average of ~21.5 dollars per month.            
+ If the pet is a dog, the monthly income additionally increases by ~58.9 dollars.   
+ There is no additional monthly income increase if the pet is a cat.     
+ For each additional photo posted, the monthly income increases by ~5.9 dollars.   
+ For each additional video posted, the monthly income increases by ~17.9 dollars.  

Inspecting the standard errors and p-values are important. The standard error helps to estimate the range of values that our true model parameter is likely to fall within. The p-value is used as a yardstick to conclude if our true model parameter is indeed non-zero.    

We can extract and plot 95% confidence intervals for our model coefficients. The 95% confidence interval is actually a random interval that is expected to contain the true model parameter i.e. $\beta_0, \cdots, \beta_4$ 95% of the time. A narrow and non-zero confidence interval indicates a convincing association between an independent variable and the outcome.    

```{r}
#| output: true

# Output 95% confidence intervals for model coefficients -----------------------
# We can also output confidence intervals as a tidy table using broom::tidy()
# mlr_model |> tidy(conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)

confint(mlr_model)
```

The plot below clearly illustrates that being a cat is the only independent variable that is not predictive of monthly pet influencer income.  

```{r}
#| output: true

# Plot 95% confidence intervals for model coefficients -------------------------
# Set p-value cut-off at p < 0.001 

coef_names <- c(
  "(Intercept)" = "Intercept",
  "train$is_dog" = "Is a dog",
  "train$is_cat" = "Is a cat",
  "train$photos" = "Photos",
  "train$videos" = "Videos"
)

modelplot(mlr_model,
          coef_map = coef_names) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, 
             colour = "firebrick",
             linetype = "dotted") +
  aes(colour = ifelse(p.value < 0.001, "Significant", "Not significant")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("grey", "black")) + 
  labs(title = "95% CI for linear regression model coefficients",
         x = "Coefficients",
       colour = NULL) +
    theme_classic() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = "grey70",
                                          linetype = "dotted"))
```
  
Although model coefficients tell us how our model makes a prediction and which independent variables are predictive of the outcome, we cannot use them to evaluate whether our model is actually a good or poor one. To evaluate our model, we need to examine some different metrics.  


# Evaluate a linear regression model   

A linear regression model outputs several metrics and plots which are useful for model evaluation. A summary of the key metrics are below.  

| Metric | Description |  
|:-------|:------------|   
| Residual mean square (MSE) |  |   
| Residual standard error |  |   
| F statistic |  |   
| Multiple $r^2$ |  |   
| Adjusted $r^2$ |  |   


We can examine the model metrics of our model using the `tidy()` function

```{r}

```

## MSE   
## r^2 and adjusted r^2   
## residual plots
